# About Me

-----

Hello. I am Jordan Powell, a.k.a MrDedSec. I am a freelance Cyber Security Researcher and I do some occasional consulting. This site contains my research and findings, which I hope you find interesting and insightful.

My main focus of my work is vulnerability disclosures, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, OSINT, and much more. I always enjoy learning about new subjects and getting hands-on experience.

If you wish to contact me please contact me on my LinkedIn.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy!
