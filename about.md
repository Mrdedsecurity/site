My work focuses primarily on vulnerability disclosure, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, OSINT, and more. I’m passionate about continuously learning and gaining hands-on experience across new areas of cybersecurity.

I have spoken at several conferences and events, including BSides Leeds and BSides Newcastle.

I am an alumnus of Leeds Beckett University and previously served as President of the Leeds Beckett University Ethical Hacking Society.
